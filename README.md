# Content-Curator
This is my first personal project in 2019. It is an algorithm I call C2A(Content Curator Algorithm). 
The algorithm, written in vanilla javascript at its core, is very lean and mean as it can sift through over a million words in about 11seconds( if your content is relatively clean). 
I also took the opportunity to play around with a UI framework that offers material design components. This can easily be removed as it is not required by the core algorithm to function.
The modular nature means that it can be customised easily and some of the graphic features can be easily removed or customised to gain an even higher performance. 
NOTE: You can use the external foulWrds.js file and add or remove words you wish to be detected in the array if you wish to add some modularity to the program. Also, remove the comment on the js file link at the bottom of the index.html file(it could reduce performance).
A jQuery plugin called highlight-within-textarea by lonekorean was used to gain the ability to highlight words in the text area which seems impossible by default. It can be easily removed to gain performance as it is not required by the algorithm to fuction.
